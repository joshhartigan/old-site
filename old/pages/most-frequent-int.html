        <p>Mathematically, this problem would be rephrased as 'Find the Mode of an Array'. So, the function we write to solve the problem will be named <code>mode()</code>.</p>
        <p>The function will take an array of integers as its argument, and simply return the element that appears the most in the array. So, how do we build an algorithm to do that?</p>
        <p>An efficient, and considerably easy, method would be to use a hash table. If the <code>mode()</code> function is given an array of 2 integers <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, it will create a table like this:</p>
        <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OgsnVjx.png"/></p>
        <p>Where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the elements of the array, and <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the number of times they occur in the array respectively. To calculate the frequencies of an array's elements, like <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, we must iterate through the elements and follow this routine:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Check if the array's element is already in the hash table. We will call this boolean <code>in</code>.</li>
            <li>If <code>in</code> is true - and the element's already in thetable - simply iterate the element's value in the table - that is, <code>element:occurrences</code> becomes <code>element:occurences + 1</code>.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if <code>in</code> is false, and the element isn't in the table, place it in the table with a value of 1, representing 1 occurrence.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>The image below shows how the routine applies to the list <code>[3, 6, 4, 1, 9, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3]</code>, at each point that the loop's iteration is at a 3:</p>
        <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tJxou2m.png"/></p>
        <p>At first, <code>in</code> is false, because 3 is not yet in the hash table. So, the algorithm puts it in the table with a value of 1 (represented in the image by <i>{3:1}</i>.</p>
        <p>At the next iteration at a 3, <code>in</code> is true, of course. So rather than placing the element in the table, the algorithm increments its value - <i>{3:1}</i> becomes <i>{3:2}</i>. The same thing happens at the last appearence of 3, incrementing its value by 1 again, to become 3.</p>
        <p>After all of that algorithmicity, we are left with a hash table of array elements and their frequencies. If we used the array shown in the last image, our table would be <code>{3:3, 6:1, 4:1, 1:2, 9:1, 8:1, 2:1}</code>.</p>
        <p>What we need our <code>mode()</code> function to calculate now is which element (or <b>key</b>) has the highest value. Here's the routine to follow for that:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Define a variable with a name like <code>maxKey</code>, initial value of 0.</li>
            <li>Iterate through each key of the hash table (i.e. 3, 6, 4, 1, etc.)</li>
            <li>For each key in the table, if it's value is bigger than <code>maxKey</code>, <code>maxKey</code>'s value get's changed to the key (not the key's value).</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>After the loop described above, `maxKey` will store the element of the array that has the highest frequency (in our example's case, 3). The `mode()` function will return it, and it's finished!</p>
        <p>Here is a <code>mode()</code> function that follows the exact same routines, in python:</p>
