Hello, my name is Josh. I have been learning programming for about 2 years, and I think I always will be learning; programming doesn't seem to be something that somebody finishes learning about.
The languages I have learnt, in chronological order, consist of these:

* Java
* Python
* C++
* C
* JavaScript
* Haskell
* Go

I specifically enjoy writing in Python, Haskell, and Go, but I like C as well. Whilst JavaScript is an okay language if you forgive it's inconsistencies, I don't like the atmosphere that surrounds it (e.g. Brogrammers, *always use jQuery*, etc.) I don't like C++ for many reasons.

If you want to see what my code looks like, [here](https://github.com/joshhartigan) is my GitHub, and [here](https://github.com/joshhartigan/semicircle) is my 180 days of programming repo.
