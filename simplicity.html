  <h1>Minim: Programming and Simplicity</h1>

  <p>The best programming languages should be <strong>simple.</strong></p>

  <p>By 'simple', I mean none of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simple and concise syntax</li>
    <li>A Simple / Small standard library</li>
    <li>A simple, specific domain to target </li>
  </ul>

  <p>What I really mean is this: a programming language should be a
  <strong>simple</strong> interface between the programmer and the computer.</p>
  <p>I shouldn't have to spend time setting up filepaths and packages for my
  project that comply with specific rules. I shouldn't have to install a
  plethora of package managers and configure a bunch of strange dotfiles just
  to use somebody else's library in my project. I should be able to follow my
  own style standards when writing code in a programming language.</p>

  <p>The programming language I am designing (and slowly implementing),
  <a href="http://joshhartigan.github.io/minim">Minim</a>, is an attempt to be
  a language that complies with this definition of simplicity. To demonstrate
  this, here is how code in a Minim project <em>could</em> be organised:</p>


  <h3>Simple Project Structure</h3>

  <pre>
  myGameProject/
    myGameProject.min
    character.min
    monsters.min
    levels.min
    screen.min
  </pre>

  <p>If the programmer is comfortable with that structure, then it's fine - they
  can leave it that way. The program is run by interpreting the main file
  (myGameProject.min) as such:</p>

  <p> <code>minim myGameProject.min</code> </p>

  <p>All the other files in the folder can be accessed from within
  myGameProject.min simply:</p>

  <p> <code>monsters.goblin()</code>; <code>levels.loadLevel1()</code>; etc.</p>

  <p>...but what if the programmer wants their code split into different
  folders for organisation?</p>



  <h3>Folder-Based Project Structure</h3>

  <pre>
  myGameProject/
    myGameProject.min
    levels.min

    entity/
      character.min
      monsters.min

    graphics/
      screen.min
  </pre>

  <p>The files inside the other folders can be enabled for access from
  myGameProject.min very simply, too. All the programmer needs to do is use a
  <code>with</code> line in the main file:</p>

  <pre>
  // in myGameProject.min:
  with &quot;entity&quot;
  with &quot;graphics&quot;

  //...
  screen.start();
  monsters.goblin();
  </pre>

  <p>There are no package declarations needed, no project structure/config file.
  Just folders and source code.</p>
