  <h1>Lishp</h1>

  <p>Lishp <i class="etym">(etym: Eng<b>lish</b> + <b>lisp</b>
  (a programming language))</i> is a <abbr title="read: non-Turing complete">
  simple</abbr> programming language that compiles down to Python, and is
  designed to be ultra-readable, via close similarity to the syntax of the
  English language.</p>

  <p>A snippet of Lishp code can demonstrate this quality:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  say hello, world!
  set my_name to "Lishp"
  say I am called {my_name}
  set age to 10
  add 1 to age
  say Next year I will be {age}</pre>

  <p>The <code>say</code> command takes plain, un-quoted text as an argument,
  and prints the text to standard output. When the value of a variable needs
  to be included in the text, its identifier is surrounded in braces, as seen
  in the example above with <code>{my_name}</code> and <code>{age}</code>.

  <h2 class="scroll" id="typing">Typing</h2>

  <p>Lishp is dynamically typed, with variable declaration following the
  syntax</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  set [VAR_NAME] to [VAR_EXPR]</pre>

  <p>where <code>[VAR_EXPR]</code> is an expression, usually just a literal
  number or string, however any mathematical expression could be used, such as</p>

  <div class="math">
    4 &times; 5 &minus; 8 + ({x} &times; 3)
  </div>

  <p>The evaluation is handled by Python's <code>eval()</code> function, but
  variable identifiers are swapped out for their values beforehand: variables
  can be used in a mathematical expression with the usual braces syntax.</p>

  <h2 class="scroll" id="strings">Strings</h2>

  <p>When a variable is assigned to a string value, the value is surrounded in
  double quotes. Concatenation of strings does not require a special character
  such as a <code>+</code> or <code>,</code> symbol, but is done as such:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  set home to "United" " " "Kingdom"</pre>

  <p>Concatenation of string identifiers can also be done in the same way:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  set name to "Josh"
  set surname to "Hartigan"
  set full_name to {name} " " {surname}

  // the following will print "Josh Hartigan".
  say full_name</pre>
