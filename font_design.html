  <p>I decided to try and design an (incomplete) font just for fun, without any
  knowledge of typographical design beforehand. I also decided to document the
  steps I took to achieve it.</p>

  <p>Once I'd decided I was going to design a serif font (no particular reason),
  I chose certain fonts I had already used, to see how they looked in true
  detail and find common characteristics between them.</p>

  <p>I then selected one of these fonts &mdash; Adelle, the fourth font shown
  &mdash; to see what ratio of width:height it used. Here's what I got:</p>

  <img src="resources/font_design_ratio.png" alt="Ratio" />

  <p>1:1 was probably the best ratio to use, since 202:193 is pretty random, and
  20:19 might as well be 1:1. I didn't use any proper mathematics in deciding
  the ratio I would use, but I think it turned out fine.</p>


  <h2 id="creation">Creation of the Font
    <a class="back-to-top scroll" href="#top-title">back to top</a>
  </h2>

  <p>For the actual creation of the letters in my own font, I drew them out on
  grid paper &mdash; I think this is the best way to do it, since I'm better
  with a pencil than I'll ever be with a pen tool.</p>

  <img src="resources/font_design_drawing.jpg" alt="Drawing" />

  <p>As you can see I tried to keep consistency &mdash; serifs are usually the
  same width and height, the letters are all 1:1 ratio, etc.</p>
  <p>After drawing out a few letters on paper, I used Pixelmator (basically
  Photoshop &minus; Supercost) to vectorise each shape. Of course the drawings
  weren't exact, and so copy-and-paste enabled me to have both of the
  stems/pillars/whatever at either side of the <code>H</code> have the same
  shape, size, and curve.</p>


  <h2 id="result">A Small, Final Result
    <a class="back-to-top scroll" href="#top-title">back to top</a>
  </h2>

  <p>Here's what I had after I finished vectorising the <code>H</code> &mdash;
  my one is the one in the middle labelled 'Block Grande', and the other two are
  the <code>H</code>s of the fonts they are labelled as.</p>

  <img src="resources/font_design_h.png" alt="H" />

  <p>I'm fairly pleased with how it turned out. It's quite thick, which I'm not
  too keen on, but that's what has given it its name 'Block Grande'.</p>
  <p>Now I just need to create 127 others of these &mdash; and that's only if I
  want to support ASCII, let alone Unicode.</p>
