        <h1 name="listoftopics"><a class="sec" href="#listoftopics"># </a>List of Topics</h1>
    <p>This is intended to be an expandable list of computer science and programming topics
    for me to learn, fully. I will write on each topic after I feel like I have learnt it
    properly.</p>
    <p>As I write this paragraph (June 7th 2014), the average length of one of the topics
    I've written on is 377 words. With 100 topics, that gives a total of around 37 700
    words; longer than <em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em> by C S Lewis (36 363
    words)</p>

    <h4>Strategic, Effective Learning</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't be afraid of difficulty. Capability comes automatically with the will to
        learn.</li>
        <li>Learn X by doing X.
            <ul>
                <li>Find a good book, class, or other means of learning, prevent yourself from
                'skimming'. Finish the most easy-seeming examples.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create related exercises after you have finished one.</li>
                        <li>Break things on purpose, so you can see when and how errors are
                        generated.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Find an idea of a project to build, and apply your learning to it whenever
        possible.</li>
        <li>Attempt to commit to your project at least a little bit every day, where
        possible; keeping it fresh in your mind, and ensuring memory.</li>
        <li>Remember that you're learning a lot of things, and some of the things you're
        learning will make other things easier - an incentive for memorising and practicing
        all topics.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to start small.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to grow big.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid of having to restart.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Programming Practices</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>When a variable will be used in more than just a small area (e.g. a for loop),
        single-letter names are <strong>bad</strong>.</li>
        <li>You don't always need a class:
            <ul>
                <li>Are you combining data <em>and</em> routines?</li>
                <li>Will your class be used more than once?</li>
                <li>Would another developer assume that you would have created a class?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You don't always need to write a routine:
            <ul>
                <li>Will the routine be used more than once or twice?</li>
                <li>Is it accessible by all parts of the program that need it?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Documentation is <em>part</em> of your software. Don't forget it.</li>
        <li>Write comments, but only when they're necessary.
            <ul>
                <li>If your code is difficult to understand:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You might have written it badly.</li>
                        <li>You might have named variables undescriptively.</li>
                        <li>If both of those things are false, then commenting is needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Don't ignore a language's standard library. There could be a plethora of things
        to make your life easier that you are not noticing.</li>
        <li>The compiler doesn't mind if you split your code up. Organise it neatly, don't
        have an enormous main function, and don't have spaghetti code.</li>
        <li>You will never 'know' all of a programming language.</li>
    </ul>
