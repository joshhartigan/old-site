        <p>Python is a good language to write in because of its simplicity, which makes programming easier than usual
        as a result, as well as being very fun to write in. It is commonly used for scripting and web programming
        but as it is a general-purpose language, there is not much of a limit as to what can be written in Python.</p>
        <p>Python is a language that follows a trending practice in software construction - it is a reasonably simple
        language, and its power is utilized best with both first-party and third-party modules, of which there are
        many.
        <br/>Python is a dynamic language, performing many actions at run time rather than compilation time -- in fact,
        Python doesn't <i>have</i> compilation time; it is an interpreted language.</p>
        <p>Before the language is looked at from a close-up perspective, a few last things:
        <ul>
            <li>Python is open source under the PSF license (GPL compatible)</li>
            <li>It has an interactive interpreter, which is very useful for testing features
            of the language, and your own functions.</li>
            <li>Python has well-designed object-oriented design features.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>In terms of basic, 'core' features of a language, Python has all the common data types that would be expected
        in a general-purpose language - numbers, strings, lists, and hash tables (in Python, hash tables are more commonly
        referred to as 'dictionaries'). As previously mentioned, OOP is supported: Python has classes and multi-inheritance.
        Errors and exceptions are built in to the language, and mismatched types will raise an exception (e.g. "hello" + 9 is
        an example of string + int).
        <br/>A very helpful, whilst not unique, feature of Python is its memory management, removing the need to allocate and free
        memory by hand in your programs.</p>

        <h1 name="syntax"><a class="sec" href="#syntax"># </a>Python's Syntax</h1>
        <p>Here is an example of Python's simple and clear syntax: The <i>hello, world</i> program:</p>
        <pre>
        print "hello, world!"</pre>
        <p>Comparing Python to Java - another powerful language that is also beginner-friendly - the language's simplicity can be
        seen very easily. Because everything in Java has to be in a class, there is boilerplate code that is necessary as well.
        Here is our <i>hello world</i> program in Java:</p>
        <pre>
        public class HelloWorld {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("hello, world!");
            }
        }</pre>
        <p>Unlike many C-Like languages which use {braces} and sem;colons, Python has <b>significant whitespace</b>. This means that
        the scope of a block of code (like an if statement, a function, or a class) is defined by its indentation, rather than its
        being wrapped in braces - like the Java code above. If we wanted to create a class called <code>HelloWorld</code>, with the
        same function <code>main</code> in Python, it would look like this:
        <pre>
        class HelloWorld:
            def main(args):
                print "hello, world!"</pre>
        It is the colons that <b>begin</b> the scope of the class or function, and the indentation of code that shows the interpeter
        which scope of code a line is in - so, the line 'print "hello, world" is in the function main()'s scope, which is in the class
        HelloWorld's scope.</p>

        <p>If you're interested in learning the language, here are some websites and books I can recommend. None of these
        sources need programming experience, but the books are still good if you are already a programmer:</p>
